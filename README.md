# Networking Inventory System
The following is created by Tiber_DarkZ with the backbone of the project being carlboisvertdev's tutorial on Unity Netcode For GameObject series.
The project does not rely on this system, but excpects you to already have the grasps on the networking part of Unity.

I highly recommand anyway trying to use this code under the license to also check out fellow developer carlboisvertdev's Multiplayer with UGS repository and youtube tutorials:

# How to use:
- Add a DataPersistanceManager to your scene and add a filename
- Create a function to update the StoreFileDataManager.Instance.IsHost whenever the host starts a game (This can be done in the main menu! Example: When the host presses the Host Game button)
- (OPTIONAL) Add a chest to your scene and add the ChestController component on it
NOTICE: SOME OBJECTS IN SCREENSHOT REQUIRE NETWORK OBJECT
